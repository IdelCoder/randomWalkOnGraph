# randomWalkOnGraph

Create undirected graph, and set many random walks at different nodes. 

There are 3 plots. Plot 1 (and 2) displays the mean (and variance) distance of all the walks from their starting points. Plot 3 displays the degree of the final destination node of all the walks. 

To run, install these libraries.
